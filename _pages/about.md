Explore my research in photonic structures and condensed matter physics.

Mid-Infrared Light Sources
======
Mid-infrared light sources are easy to find. Any object at room temperature emits light mainly in the mid-infrared region of the electromagnetic spectrum, about 2-25 microns in wavelength. What is not so easy to find is a source of mid-infrared light that emits at a single wavelength. Even more difficult still is a device whose emission wavelength can be changed simply by applying a voltage. My work focuses on improving upon the efforts put forth so far to create such a device.

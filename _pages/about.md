Explore my research in photonic structures and condensed matter physics.

Mid-Infrared Light Sources
======
Mid-infrared light sources are easy to find. Any object at room temperature emits light mainly in the mid-infrared region of the electromagnetic spectrum, about 2-25 microns in wavelength. What is not so easy to find is a source of mid-infrared light that emits at a single wavelength. Even more difficult still is a source whose emission wavelength can be changed simply by turning a knob. My work focuses on improving upon the efforts put forth so far to create such a device.

Bilayer Graphene and Scanning Tunneling Microscopy
------
Bilayer graphene is a material that is uniquely poised to bring about monumental changes in fundamental physics, applied physics, and technology. However, many of its properties that require greater understanding can only be measured with a scanning tunneling microscope. This microscope uses a metal tip to image individual atoms, but must get very close to do so. In the case of bilayer graphene, the proximity of the tip alters the properties of this material. In [our first publication on this topic](https://gholdman1.github.io/publication/blg-in-stm), we explore the nature of this invasive probe.

Explore my research in photonic structures and condensed matter physics.

Mid-Infrared Light Sources
======
Mid-infrared light sources are easy to find. Any object at room temperature emits light mainly in the mid-infrared region of the electromagnetic spectrum, about 2-25 microns in wavelength. What is not so easy to find is a source of mid-infrared light that emits at a single wavelength. Even more difficult still is a device whose emission wavelength can be changed simply by applying a voltage. My work focuses on improving upon the efforts put forth so far to create such a device.

**Markdown generator**

I have also created [a set of Jupyter notebooks](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/tree/master/markdown_generator
) that converts a CSV containing structured data about talks or presentations into individual markdown files that will be properly formatted for the academicpages template. The sample CSVs in that directory are the ones I used to create my own personal website at stuartgeiger.com. My usual workflow is that I keep a spreadsheet of my publications and talks, then run the code in these notebooks to generate the markdown files, then commit and push them to the GitHub repository.

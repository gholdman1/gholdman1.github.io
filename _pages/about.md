Mid-Infrared Light Sources
======
Mid-infrared light sources are easy to find. Any object at room temperature emits light mainly in the mid-infrared region of the electromagnetic spectrum, (2-25 microns in wavelength). However, light is emitted from these objects at *all* wavelengths. In some cases, it is more desirable to have a source of mid-infrared light that emits at a single wavelength which can be selected by turning a knob. [Michelson Interferometers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michelson_interferometer) and [Quantum Cascade Lasers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_cascade_laser) are already capable of this, but the former is bulky and the latter is too expensive to be commonly used. My work focuses on creating a device that is both smaller and cheaper than the existing technology.


Graphene
------

Any useful tunable thermal emitter must incorporate a material that changes the way it interacts with light. Graphene is a prime example of such a material. The "optical conductivity" of graphene (another way of saying "the response of electrons in graphene to light") can be changed simply by hooking up a few wires and turning on a voltage. Moreover, this change mainly occurs in the mid-infrared region.

Bilayer Graphene and Scanning Tunneling Microscopy
------
Bilayer graphene is a material that is uniquely poised to bring about monumental changes in fundamental physics, applied physics, and technology. However, many of its properties that require greater understanding can only be measured with a scanning tunneling microscope. This microscope uses a metal tip to image individual atoms, but must get very close to do so. In the case of bilayer graphene, the proximity of the tip alters the properties of this material. In [our first publication on this topic](https://gholdman1.github.io/publication/blg-in-stm), we explore the nature of this invasive probe.
